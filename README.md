# Random Pointer Linked List Copy

This project contains a Python implementation of a deep copy function for a singly linked list where each node has an additional random pointer pointing to any node or null.

## Features

- Deep copy of linked list with random pointers  
- Object-oriented Python code  
- Time complexity: O(n)  
- Space optimized approach

## Usage

Run `solution.py` to test the implementation.
